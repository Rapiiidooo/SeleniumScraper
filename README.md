## Requirement

You need to install and add to path if you want automated detection of your driver :

- Chrome : http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
- Firefox : https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
- PhantomJS : http://phantomjs.org/download.html
- Safari : safaridriver is native on MacOS

Otherwise you will have to give the path manually in the option.
